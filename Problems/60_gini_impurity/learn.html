<h2>Understanding Gini Impurity</h2>

Gini impurity is a statistical measurement of the impurity or disorder in a list
of elements. It is commonly used in decision tree algorithms to decide the
optimal split at tree nodes. It is calculated as follows, where p<sub>i</sub> is
the probability of each class - n<sub>i</sub>/n: \[ \text{Gini Impurity} = 1 -
\sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2 \] A gini impurity of 0 indicates a node where all element
are the same class, whereas, a gini impurity of 0.5 indicates a maximum
impurity, where elements are evenly distributed among each class. This means
that a lower impurity implies a more homogenous distribution of elements,
suggesting a good split, as decision tress aim to minimise it at each node.
