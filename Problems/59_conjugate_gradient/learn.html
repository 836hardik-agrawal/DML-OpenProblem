<h2>Understanding The Conjugate Gradient Method</h2>

The Conjugate Gradient, CG, method is an iterative algorithm used to solve large
systems of linear equations, particularly those that are symmetric and
positive-definite.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

The CG gradient method is often applied to the quadratic form of a linear
system, Ax = b: \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x - b^T x \] The quadratic form is
used due to its' differential reducing to, the following for a symmetric A.
Therefore, x satisfies Ax = b, at the optimum: \[ f'(x) = Ax - b \]

The conjugate gradient method uses search directions that are conjugate to all
the previous search direction. This is satisfied when search directions are
A-orthogonal, i.e. \[ p_i^T A p_j = 0 \quad \text{for } i \neq j \] This results
in a more efficient algorithm, as it ensures that the algorithm gathers all
information in a search direction at once, and then doesn't need to search in
that direction again. As opposed to steepest descent, that will step a bit in
one direction and then may search in that direction later.

<h4>Algorithm Steps</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Initialization:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>\( x_0 \): Initial guess for the variable vector.</li>
      <li>\( r_0 = b - A x_0 \) - Initial residual vector.</li>
      <li>\( p_0 = r_0 \) - Initial search direction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Iteration \( k \):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>\( \alpha_k = \frac{r_k^T r_k}{p_k^T A p_k} \) - Step size.</li>
      <li>\( x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k \) - Update solution.</li>
      <li>\( r_{k+1} = r_k - \alpha_k A p_k \) - Update residual.</li>
      <li>Check convergence: \( \| r_{k+1} \| < \text{tolerance} \).</li>
      <li>
        \( \beta_k = \frac{r_{k+1}^T r_{k+1}}{r_k^T r_k} \) - New direction
        scaling. This ensures search directions are A-orthogonal.
      </li>
      <li>\( p_{k+1} = r_{k+1} + \beta_k p_k \) - Update search direction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Termination:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stop when \( \| r_{k+1} \| < \text{tolerance} \) or after a set number
        of iterations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Applications</h4>
The conjugate gradient method is often used as it's more efficient that other
iterative solvers, such as steepest descent, and direct solvers, such as
Gaussian Elimination. Iterative linear solvers are commonly used in
optimisation, machine learning and computational fluid dynamics.
