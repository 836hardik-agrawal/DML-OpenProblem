<h2>Implementing Early Stopping Criterion</h2>

<p>
  Early stopping is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting in
  machine learning models. Your task is to implement the early stopping decision
  logic based on the validation loss history.
</p>

<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>
  Given a sequence of validation losses from model training, determine if
  training should be stopped based on the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Training should stop if the validation loss hasn't improved (decreased) for
    a specified number of epochs (patience)
  </li>
  <li>
    An improvement is only counted if the loss decreases by more than a minimum
    threshold (min_delta)
  </li>
  <li>The best model is the one with the lowest validation loss</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
  Consider the following validation losses: [0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.77, 0.76, 0.77,
  0.78]
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    With patience=2 and min_delta=0.01:
    <ul>
      <li>Best loss is 0.75 at epoch 2</li>
      <li>No improvement > 0.01 for next 2 epochs</li>
      <li>Should stop at epoch 4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Function Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Return both the epoch to stop at and the best epoch</li>
  <li>If no stopping is needed, return the last epoch</li>
  <li>Epochs are 0-indexed</li>
</ul>
