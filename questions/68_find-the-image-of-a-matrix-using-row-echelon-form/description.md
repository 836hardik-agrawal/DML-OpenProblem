## Task: Compute the Column Space of a Matrix

In this task, you are required to implement a function `matrix_image(A)` that calculates the column space of a given matrix `A`. The column space, also known as the image or span, consists of all linear combinations of the columns of `A`. To find this, you'll use concepts from linear algebra, focusing on identifying independent columns that span the matrix's image.
**Your task:** Implement the function `matrix_image(A)` to return the basis vectors that span the column space of `A`. These vectors should be extracted from the original matrix and correspond to the independent columns.
