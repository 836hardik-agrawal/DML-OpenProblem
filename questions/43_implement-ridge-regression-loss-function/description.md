Write a Python function `ridge_loss` that implements the Ridge Regression loss function. The function should take a 2D numpy array `X` representing the feature matrix, a 1D numpy array `w` representing the coefficients, a 1D numpy array `y_true` representing the true labels, and a float `alpha` representing the regularization parameter. The function should return the Ridge loss, which combines the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a regularization term.
