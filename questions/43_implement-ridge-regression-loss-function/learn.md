## Ridge Regression Loss

Ridge Regression is a linear regression method with a regularization term to prevent overfitting by controlling the size of the coefficients.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Regularization**:  
   Adds a penalty to the loss function to discourage large coefficients, helping to generalize the model.

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:  
   Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

3. **Penalty Term**:  
   The sum of the squared coefficients, scaled by the regularization parameter $ \lambda $, which controls the strength of the regularization.

### Ridge Loss Function
The Ridge Loss function combines MSE and the penalty term:
$$
L(\beta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2
$$

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Calculate MSE**:  
   Compute the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

2. **Add Regularization Term**:  
   Compute the sum of squared coefficients multiplied by $ \lambda $.

3. **Combine and Minimize**:  
   Sum MSE and the regularization term to form the Ridge loss, then minimize this loss to find the optimal coefficients.
