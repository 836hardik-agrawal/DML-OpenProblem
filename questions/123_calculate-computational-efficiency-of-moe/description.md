Calculate the computational cost savings of an MoE layer compared to a dense layer, as discussed in the paper 'Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer.' Given the number of experts, sparsity (number of active experts), and input/output dimensions, compute the floating-point operations (FLOPs) for both and determine the savings percentage.
