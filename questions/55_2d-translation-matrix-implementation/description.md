## Task: Implement a 2D Translation Matrix

Your task is to implement a function that applies a 2D translation matrix to a set of points. A translation matrix is used to move points in 2D space by a specified distance in the x and y directions.

Write a function `translate_object(points, tx, ty)` where `points` is a list of [x, y] coordinates and `tx` and `ty` are the translation distances in the x and y directions, respectively.

The function should return a new list of points after applying the translation matrix.
