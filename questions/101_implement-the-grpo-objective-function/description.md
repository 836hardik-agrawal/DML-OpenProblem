Implement the GRPO (Generalized Relative Policy Optimization) objective function used to optimize policy parameters in reinforcement learning. Your task is to compute the GRPO objective given the likelihood ratios, advantage estimates, old policy probabilities, reference policy probabilities, and apply the clipping mechanism and KL divergence penalty correctly to maintain training stability.
