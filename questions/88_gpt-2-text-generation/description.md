### Implement a Simplified GPT-2-like Text Generation Function

You are tasked with implementing a simplified GPT-2-like text generation function in Python. This function will incorporate the following components of a minimal GPT-2 architecture:

- **Token Embeddings**: Map input tokens to dense vector representations.
- **Positional Embeddings**: Add positional information to token embeddings.
- **Multi-head Attention**: Attend to various parts of the sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Network**: Process attention outputs through a dense layer.
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize the training process.

The function must take in the following parameters:

1. **Prompt**: The initial text to guide the generation process.
2. **Number of Tokens to Generate**: Specify how many tokens to output.

Your function should output the generated text.

Additionally, utilize the helper function `load_encoder_hparams_and_params` to retrieve:

- A dummy encoder.
- Model hyperparameters.
- Model parameters.

Build your text generation logic around these components. This exercise is designed to help you understand the core concepts behind GPT-2's autoregressive text generation.
