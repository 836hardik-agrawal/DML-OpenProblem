## Balancing Trend and Fluctuation with Math

When dealing with time-series data, it's common to see both a long-term trend and periodic fluctuations. In this challenge, the daily fluctuation for day $i$ is given by:

$$
f_i = 10 \times \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \times i}{10}\right).
$$

### Steps to Solve

1. **Fluctuation Removal**: Subtract $f_i$ from each day's consumption to isolate the colony's base usage.

2. **Linear Regression**: Fit a linear model $y = mx + b$ using the detrended values. The slope $m$ and intercept $b$ are calculated using the least squares method:

$$
m = \frac{n \sum(x_i y_i) - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n \sum(x_i^2) - (\sum x_i)^2}, \quad b = \frac{\sum y_i - m \sum x_i}{n}.
$$

Here, $n$ is the number of data points (10 in this case).

3. **Forecast**: Use the regression line to predict the base consumption for day 15, $x = 15$:

$$
\text{base}_{15} = m \times 15 + b.
$$

4. **Add Back Fluctuation**: Compute $f_{15} = 10 \times \sin\left(\frac{2\pi \times 15}{10}\right)$ and add it to the base prediction:

$$
\text{pred}_{15} = \text{base}_{15} + f_{15}.
$$

5. **Round and Add Safety Margin**: Round $\text{pred}_{15}$ to the nearest integer and then apply a 5% upward safety margin to ensure sufficient capacity:

$$
\text{final}_{15} = \lceil 1.05 \times \text{round}(\text{pred}_{15}) \rceil.
$$

### Summary

By following these steps **removing the fluctuation**, **fitting the linear model**, **predicting day 15**'s base consumption, **restoring the fluctuation**, and **applying a safety margin** you'll arrive at a robust energy requirement forecast for the colony's future needs.
