## Calculating the Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix

The inverse of a matrix \( A \) is another matrix, often denoted \( A^{-1} \), such that:
$$
AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I
$$
where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For a 2x2 matrix:
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b \\ 
c & d 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The inverse is given by:
$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix} 
d & -b \\ 
-c & a 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

provided that the determinant \( \det(A) = ad - bc \) is non-zero. If \( \det(A) = 0 \), the matrix does not have an inverse.

### Importance
Calculating the inverse of a matrix is essential in various applications, such as solving systems of linear equations, where the inverse is used to find solutions efficiently.
