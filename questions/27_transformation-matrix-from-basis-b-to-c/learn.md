## Understanding Transformation Matrices

A transformation matrix allows us to convert the coordinates of a vector in one basis to coordinates in another basis. For bases \( B \) and \( C \) of a vector space, the transformation matrix \( P \) from \( B \) to \( C \) is calculated as follows:

### Steps to Calculate the Transformation Matrix
1. **Inverse of Basis \( C \)**: First, find the inverse of the matrix representing basis \( C \), denoted \( C^{-1} \).
2. **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply \( C^{-1} \) by the matrix of basis \( B \). The result is the transformation matrix:
   $$
   P = C^{-1} \cdot B
   $$

This matrix \( P \) can be used to transform any vector coordinates from the \( B \) basis to the \( C \) basis.
