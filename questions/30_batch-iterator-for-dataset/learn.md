## Understanding Batch Iteration

Batch iteration is a common technique used in machine learning and data processing to handle large datasets more efficiently. Instead of processing the entire dataset at once, which can be memory-intensive, data is processed in smaller, more manageable batches.

### Step-by-Step Method to Create a Batch Iterator

1. **Determine the Number of Samples**  
   Calculate the total number of samples in the dataset.

2. **Iterate in Batches**  
   Loop through the dataset in increments of the specified batch size.

3. **Yield Batches**  
   For each iteration, yield a batch of samples from \( X \) and, if provided, the corresponding samples from \( y \).

### Key Point
This method ensures efficient processing and can be used for both the training and evaluation phases in machine learning workflows.
