## Understanding Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method in linear algebra for decomposing a matrix into three other matrices. For a given matrix \( A \), SVD is represented as:
$$
A = U \cdot S \cdot V^T
$$

### Step-by-Step Method to Calculate the SVD of a 2x2 Matrix by Hand

1. **Calculate \( A^T A \) and \( A A^T \)**  
   Compute the product of the matrix with its transpose and the transpose of the matrix with itself. These matrices share the same eigenvalues.

2. **Find the Eigenvalues**  
   To find the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix, solve the characteristic equation:
   $$
   \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
   $$
   This results in a quadratic equation.

3. **Compute the Singular Values**  
   The singular values, which form the diagonal elements of the matrix \( S \), are the square roots of the eigenvalues.

4. **Calculate the Eigenvectors**  
   For each eigenvalue, solve the equation:
   $$
   (A - \lambda I) \mathbf{x} = 0
   $$
   to find the corresponding eigenvector. Normalize these eigenvectors to form the columns of \( U \) and \( V \).

5. **Form the Matrices \( U \), \( S \), and \( V \)**  
   Combine the singular values and eigenvectors to construct the matrices \( U \), \( S \), and \( V \) such that:
   $$
   A = U \cdot S \cdot V^T
   $$

### Additional Notes
- This method involves solving quadratic equations to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors and normalizing these vectors to unit length.
