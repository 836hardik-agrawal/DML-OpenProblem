## Understanding AdaBoost

AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The basic idea is to fit a sequence of weak learners on weighted versions of the data.

### Implementing the Fit Method for an AdaBoost Classifier

1. **Initialize Weights**  
   Start by initializing the sample weights uniformly:
   $$
   w_i = \frac{1}{N}, \text{ where } N \text{ is the number of samples}
   $$

2. **Iterate Through Classifiers**  
   For each classifier, determine the best threshold for each feature to minimize the error.

3. **Calculate Error and Flip Polarity**  
   If the error is greater than 0.5, flip the polarity:
   $$
   \text{error} = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i [y_i \neq h(x_i)]
   $$
   $$
   \text{if error} > 0.5: \text{error} = 1 - \text{error}, \text{ and flip the polarity}
   $$

4. **Calculate Alpha**  
   Compute the weight (alpha) of the classifier based on its error rate:
   $$
   \alpha = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1 - \text{error}}{\text{error} + 1e-10} \right)
   $$

5. **Update Weights**  
   Adjust the sample weights based on the classifier's performance and normalize them:
   $$
   w_i = w_i \exp(-\alpha y_i h(x_i))
   $$
   $$
   w_i = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N w_j}
   $$

6. **Save Classifier**  
   Store the classifier with its parameters.

### Key Insight
This method helps in focusing more on the misclassified samples in subsequent rounds, thereby improving the overall performance.
