Write a Python function `adaboost_fit` that implements the fit method for an AdaBoost classifier. The function should take in a 2D numpy array `X` of shape `(n_samples, n_features)` representing the dataset, a 1D numpy array `y` of shape `(n_samples,)` representing the labels, and an integer `n_clf` representing the number of classifiers. The function should initialize sample weights, find the best thresholds for each feature, calculate the error, update weights, and return a list of classifiers with their parameters.
