  "output": "0",
  "reasoning": "Using Laplace's Expansion, the determinant of a 4x4 matrix is calculated by expanding it into minors and cofactors along any row or column. Given the symmetrical and linear nature of this specific matrix, its determinant is 0. The calculation for a generic 4x4 matrix involves more complex steps, breaking it down into the determinants of 3x3 matrices."
