## Determinant of a 4x4 Matrix using Laplace's Expansion

Laplace's Expansion, also known as cofactor expansion, is a method to calculate the determinant of a square matrix of any size. For a 4x4 matrix \( A \), this method involves expanding \( A \) into minors and cofactors along a chosen row or column.

Consider a 4x4 matrix \( A \):
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The determinant of \( A \), \( \det(A) \), can be calculated by selecting any row or column (e.g., the first row) and using the formula that involves the elements of that row (or column), their corresponding cofactors, and the determinants of the 3x3 minor matrices obtained by removing the row and column of each element. This process is recursive, as calculating the determinants of the 3x3 matrices involves further expansions.

The expansion formula for the first row is:
$$
\det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} - a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} - a_{14}C_{14}
$$

### Explanation of Terms
- **Cofactor \( C_{ij} \)**: The cofactor of element \( a_{ij} \) is given by:
  $$
  C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \det(\text{Minor of } a_{ij})
  $$
  where the minor of \( a_{ij} \) is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing the \( i \)th row and \( j \)th column from \( A \).

### Notes
- The choice of row or column for expansion can be based on convenience, often selecting one with the most zeros to simplify calculations.
- The process is recursive, breaking down the determinant calculation into smaller 3x3 determinants until reaching 2x2 determinants, which are simpler to compute.

This method is fundamental in linear algebra and provides a systematic approach for determinant calculation, especially for matrices larger than 3x3.
