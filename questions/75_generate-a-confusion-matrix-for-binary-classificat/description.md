## Task: Generate a Confusion Matrix

Your task is to implement the function `confusion_matrix(data)` that generates a confusion matrix for a binary classification problem. The confusion matrix provides a summary of the prediction results on a classification problem, allowing you to visualize how many data points were correctly or incorrectly labeled.

### Input:
- A list of lists, where each inner list represents a pair 
- `[y_true, y_pred]` for one observation. `y_true` is the actual label, and `y_pred` is the predicted label.

### Output:
- A $2 \times 2$ confusion matrix represented as a list of lists.
