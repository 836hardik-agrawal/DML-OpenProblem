## Task: Compute the R-squared Value in Regression Analysis

- R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure that indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable in a regression model. 

- **Your Task**: 
    To implement the function `r_squared(y_true, y_pred)` that calculates the R-squared value, given arrays of true values `y_true` and predicted values `y_pred`.
