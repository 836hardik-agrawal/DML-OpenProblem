Write a Python function to generate random subsets of a given dataset. The function should take in a 2D numpy array X, a 1D numpy array y, an integer n_subsets, and a boolean replacements. It should return a list of n_subsets random subsets of the dataset, where each subset is a tuple of (X_subset, y_subset). If replacements is True, the subsets should be created with replacements; otherwise, without replacements.
