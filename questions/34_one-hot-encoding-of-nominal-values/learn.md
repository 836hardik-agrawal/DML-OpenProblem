## Understanding One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is a method used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. This technique is useful in machine learning when dealing with categorical data that has no ordinal relationship.

### Explanation
In one-hot encoding, each category is represented by a binary vector with a length equal to the number of categories. The vector has a value of 1 at the index corresponding to the category and 0 at all other indices.

### Example
For instance, if you have three categories: 0, 1, and 2, the one-hot encoded vectors would be:
- **0**: $[1, 0, 0]$
- **1**: $[0, 1, 0]$
- **2**: $[0, 0, 1]$

This method ensures that the model does not assume any ordinal relationship between categories, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.

### Mathematical Representation
The one-hot encoding process can be mathematically represented as follows:

Given a category $x_i$ from a set of categories $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$, the one-hot encoded vector $\mathbf{v}$ is:
$$
\mathbf{v}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } i = x_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This vector $\mathbf{v}$ will have a length equal to the number of unique categories.
