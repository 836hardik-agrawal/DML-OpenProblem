In machine learning and statistics, the softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function that converts a vector of scores into probabilities. The log-softmax function is the logarithm of the softmax function, and it is often used for numerical stability when computing the softmax of large numbers.

Given a 1D numpy array of scores, implement a Python function to compute the log-softmax of the array.
