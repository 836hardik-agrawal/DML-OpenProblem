Special thanks to Andrej Karpathy for making a video about this, if you haven't already check out his videos on YouTube https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=gjlnFP4o3JRN9dTg. Write a Python class similar to the provided 'Value' class that implements the basic autograd operations: addition, multiplication, and ReLU activation. The class should handle scalar values and should correctly compute gradients for these operations through automatic differentiation.
