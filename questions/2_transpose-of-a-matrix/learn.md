## Transpose of a Matrix

Let's consider a matrix $M$ and its transpose $M^T$:

**Original Matrix $M$:**
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b & c \\ 
d & e & f 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Transposed Matrix $M^T$:**
$$
M^T = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & d \\ 
b & e \\ 
c & f 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Explanation:
Transposing a matrix involves converting its rows into columns and vice versa. This operation is fundamental in linear algebra for various computations and transformations.
