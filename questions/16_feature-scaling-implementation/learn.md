## Feature Scaling Techniques

Feature scaling is crucial in many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of features. This includes algorithms that use distance measures, like k-nearest neighbors, and gradient descent-based algorithms, like linear regression.

### Standardization
Standardization (or Z-score normalization) is the process where features are rescaled so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one:
$$
z = \frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}
$$
where \( x \) is the original feature, \( \mu \) is the mean of that feature, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

### Min-Max Normalization
Min-max normalization rescales the feature to a fixed range, typically 0 to 1, or it can be shifted to any range \([a, b]\) by transforming the data using the formula:
$$
x' = \frac{(x - \text{min}(x))}{(\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x))} \times (\text{max} - \text{min}) + \text{min}
$$
where \( x \) is the original value, \( \text{min}(x) \) is the minimum value for that feature, \( \text{max}(x) \) is the maximum value, and \( \text{min} \) and \( \text{max} \) are the new minimum and maximum values for the scaled data.

### Key Points
- **Equal Contribution**: Implementing these scaling techniques ensures that features contribute equally to the development of the model.
- **Improved Convergence**: Feature scaling can significantly improve the convergence speed of learning algorithms.

This structured explanation outlines the importance of feature scaling and describes two commonly used techniques with their mathematical formulas.
