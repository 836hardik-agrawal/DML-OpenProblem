Write a Python function that performs feature scaling on a dataset using both standardization and min-max normalization. The function should take a 2D NumPy array as input, where each row represents a data sample and each column represents a feature. It should return two 2D NumPy arrays: one scaled by standardization and one by min-max normalization. Make sure all results are rounded to the nearest 4th decimal.
