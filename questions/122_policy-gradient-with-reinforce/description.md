Implement the policy gradient estimator using the REINFORCE algorithm. The policy is parameterized by a 2D NumPy array `theta` of shape `(num_states, num_actions)`. The policy for each state is computed via softmax over `theta[s, :]`. Given a list of episodes (each a list of (state, action, reward) tuples), compute the average gradient of the log-policy multiplied by the return at each time step.
