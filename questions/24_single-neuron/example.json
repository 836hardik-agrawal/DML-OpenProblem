  "input": "features = [[0.5, 1.0], [-1.5, -2.0], [2.0, 1.5]], labels = [0, 1, 0], weights = [0.7, -0.4], bias = -0.1",
  "output": "([0.4626, 0.4134, 0.6682], 0.3349)",
  "reasoning": "For each input vector, the weighted sum is calculated by multiplying each feature by its corresponding weight, adding these up along with the bias, then applying the sigmoid function to produce a probability. The MSE is calculated as the average squared difference between each predicted probability and the corresponding true label."
