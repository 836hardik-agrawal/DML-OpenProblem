 # Understanding Dice Score in Classification

The Dice Score, also known as the SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient or F1-score, is a statistical measure used to gauge the similarity between two samples. It is particularly popular in image segmentation tasks and binary classification problems.

## Mathematical Definition

The Dice coefficient is defined as twice the intersection divided by the sum of the cardinalities of both sets:

$$
\text{Dice Score} = \frac{2|X \cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|} = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}
$$

### In terms of binary classification:
1. **TP (True Positives):** Number of positions where both predicted and true labels are 1.  
2. **FP (False Positives):** Number of positions where the prediction is 1 but the true label is 0.  
3. **FN (False Negatives):** Number of positions where the prediction is 0 but the true label is 1.

## Relationship with F1-Score

The Dice coefficient is identical to the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

$$
\text{F1-score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}} = \text{Dice Score}
$$

## Key Properties
1. **Range:** The Dice score always falls between 0 and 1 (inclusive).  
2. **Perfect Score:** A value of 1 indicates perfect overlap.  
3. **No Overlap:** A value of 0 indicates no overlap.  
4. **Sensitivity:** More sensitive to overlap than the Jaccard Index.  
5. **Symmetry:** The score is symmetric, meaning DSC(A,B) = DSC(B,A).

## Example

Consider two binary vectors:  
- **True labels:** [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  
- **Predicted labels:** [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  

In this case:  
- **True Positives (TP):** 3  
- **False Positives (FP):** 0  
- **False Negatives (FN):** 1  

$$
\text{Dice Score} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2 \times 3 + 0 + 1} = 0.857
$$

## Advantages Over Jaccard Index

The Dice score offers several advantages:  
1. **Higher Sensitivity to Overlap:** Due to the doubled intersection term.  
2. **Weight on Agreement:** Gives more weight to instances where labels agree.  
3. **Preferred in Medical Imaging:** Often used in medical image segmentation due to its sensitivity to overlap.  
4. **Intuitive Interpretation:** As the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Common Applications

The Dice score is widely used in:  
1. **Medical image segmentation evaluation.**  
2. **Binary classification tasks.**  
3. **Object detection overlap assessment.**  
4. **Text similarity measurement.**  
5. **Semantic segmentation evaluation.**

When implementing the Dice score, it is important to handle edge cases properly, such as when both sets are empty. In such cases, the score is typically defined as 0.0 (as per scikit-learn).
