## Task: Implement the Gaussian Elimination Method

Your task is to implement the Gaussian Elimination method, which transforms a system of linear equations into an upper triangular matrix. This method can then be used to solve for the variables using backward substitution.

Write a function `gaussian_elimination(A, b)` that performs Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting to solve the system \(Ax = b\).

The function should return the solution vector \(x\).
