Write a Python function that takes a 2-D NumPy array **X** and an integer **degree**, generates all polynomial feature combinations of the columns of **X** up to the given degree **inclusive**, **then sorts the resulting features for each sample from lowest to highest value**. The function should return a new 2-D NumPy array whose rows correspond to the input samples and whose columns are the **ascending-sorted** polynomial features.
