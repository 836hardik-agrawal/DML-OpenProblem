Write a Python function that simulates a single neuron with sigmoid activation, and implements backpropagation to update the neuron's weights and bias. The function should take a list of feature vectors, associated true binary labels, initial weights, initial bias, a learning rate, and the number of epochs. The function should update the weights and bias using gradient descent based on the MSE loss, and return the updated weights, bias, and a list of MSE values for each epoch, each rounded to four decimal places.
