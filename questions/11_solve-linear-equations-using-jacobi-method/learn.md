## Solving Linear Equations Using the Jacobi Method

The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm used for solving a system of linear equations \( Ax = b \). This method is particularly useful for large systems where direct methods, such as Gaussian elimination, are computationally expensive.


### Algorithm Overview

For a system of equations represented by \( Ax = b \), where \( A \) is a matrix and \( x \) and \( b \) are vectors, the Jacobi method involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for \( x \).

2. **Iteration**: For each equation \( i \), update \( x[i] \) using:
   $$
   x[i] = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left(b[i] - \sum_{j \neq i} a_{ij} x[j]\right)
   $$
   where \( a_{ii} \) are the diagonal elements of \( A \), and \( a_{ij} \) are the off-diagonal elements.

3. **Convergence**: Repeat the iteration until the changes in \( x \) are below a certain tolerance or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

This method assumes that all diagonal elements of \( A \) are non-zero and that the matrix is diagonally dominant or properly conditioned for convergence.

### Practical Considerations

- The method may not converge for all matrices.
- Choosing a good initial guess can improve convergence.
- Diagonal dominance of \( A \) ensures the convergence of the Jacobi method.
