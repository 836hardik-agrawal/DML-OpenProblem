## Understanding Dense Blocks and 2D Convolutions

Dense blocks are a key innovation in the DenseNet architecture. Each layer receives input from **all** previous layers, leading to rich feature reuse and efficient gradient flow.

### Dense Block Concept
For a dense block:
- **Each layer**: Applies ReLU, then 2D convolution, and then concatenates the output to previous features.
- Mathematically:
$$
x_l = H_l([x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{l-1}])
$$
where $H_l(\cdot)$ is the convolution and activation operations.

### 2D Convolution Basics
A 2D convolution at a position $(i, j)$ for input $X$ and kernel $K$ is:
$$
Y[i, j] = \sum_{m=0}^{k_h - 1} \sum_{n=0}^{k_w - 1} X[i + m, j + n] \cdot K[m, n]
$$

### Padding to Preserve Spatial Dimensions
To preserve height and width:
$$
\text{padding} = \frac{k - 1}{2}
$$

### Dense Block Growth
- Each layer adds $\text{growth rate}$ channels.
- After $L$ layers, total channels = input channels + $L \times \text{growth rate}$.

### Putting It All Together
1️⃣ Start with an input tensor.  
2️⃣ Repeat for $\text{num layers}$:
- Apply ReLU activation.
- Apply 2D convolution (with padding).
- Concatenate the output along the channel dimension.

By understanding these core principles, you’re ready to build the dense block function!
