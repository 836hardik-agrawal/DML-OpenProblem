## Understanding the Softmax Activation Function

The softmax function is a generalization of the sigmoid function and is used in the output layer of a neural network model that handles multi-class classification tasks.

### Mathematical Definition
The softmax function is mathematically represented as:
$$
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
$$

### Characteristics
- **Output Range**: Each output value is between 0 and 1, and the sum of all outputs is 1.
- **Probability Distribution**: It transforms scores into probabilities, making them easier to interpret and useful for classification tasks.

The softmax function is essential for models where the output needs to represent a probability distribution across multiple classes.
