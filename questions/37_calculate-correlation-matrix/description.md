Write a Python function to calculate the correlation matrix for a given dataset. The function should take in a 2D numpy array X and an optional 2D numpy array Y. If Y is not provided, the function should calculate the correlation matrix of X with itself. It should return the correlation matrix as a 2D numpy array.
