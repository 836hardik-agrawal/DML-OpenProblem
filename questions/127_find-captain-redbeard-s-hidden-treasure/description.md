Captain Redbeard, the most daring pirate of the seven seas, has uncovered a mysterious ancient map. Instead of islands, it shows a strange wavy curve, and the treasure lies at the lowest point of the land! (watch out for those tricky local mins)

The land's height at any point $x$ is given by:

f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2


**Your Mission:**
Implement a Python function that finds the value of $x$ where $f(x)$ reaches its minimum, starting from any random initial position.
