## Task: Compute the Orthogonal Projection of a Vector

Your task is to implement a function that calculates the orthogonal projection of a vector **v** onto another vector **L**. This projection results in the vector on **L** that is closest to **v**.

Write a function `orthogonal_projection(v, L)` that takes in two lists, `v` (the vector to be projected) and `L` (the line vector), and returns the orthogonal projection of `v` onto `L`. The function should output a list representing the projection vector rounded to three decimal places.
