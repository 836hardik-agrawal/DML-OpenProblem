Write a Python class to implement the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier for binary (0/1) feature data. Your class should have two methods: `forward(self, X, y)` to train on the input data (X: 2D NumPy array of binary features, y: 1D NumPy array of class labels) and `predict(self, X)` to output predicted labels for a 2D test matrix X. Use Laplace smoothing (parameter: smoothing=1.0). Return predictions as a NumPy array. Only use NumPy. Predictions must be binary (0 or 1) and you must handle cases where the training data contains only one class. All log/likelihood calculations should use log probabilities for numerical stability.
