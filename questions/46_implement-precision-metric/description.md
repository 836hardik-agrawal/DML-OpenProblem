Write a Python function `precision` that calculates the precision metric given two numpy arrays: `y_true` and `y_pred`. The `y_true` array contains the true binary labels, and the `y_pred` array contains the predicted binary labels. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
