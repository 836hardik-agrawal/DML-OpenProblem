## Task: Implement Cosine Similarity

In this task, you need to implement a function `cosine_similarity(v1, v2)` that calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, indicating their directional similarity.

### Input:
- `v1` and `v2`: Numpy arrays representing the input vectors.

### Output:
- A float representing the cosine similarity, rounded to three decimal places.

### Constraints:
- Both input vectors must have the same shape.
- Input vectors cannot be empty or have zero magnitude.
