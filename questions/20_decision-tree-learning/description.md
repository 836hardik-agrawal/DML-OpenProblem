Write a Python function that implements the decision tree learning algorithm for classification. The function should use recursive binary splitting based on entropy and information gain to build a decision tree. It should take a list of examples (each example is a dict of attribute-value pairs) and a list of attribute names as input, and return a nested dictionary representing the decision tree.
