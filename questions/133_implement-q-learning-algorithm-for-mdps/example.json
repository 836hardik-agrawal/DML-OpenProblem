  "reasoning": "The Q-Learning algorithm initializes a Q-table with zeros and iteratively updates it over 10 episodes by starting from random non-terminal states, selecting actions via an epsilon-greedy policy, sampling next states and rewards from the provided transition probabilities (P) and rewards (R), and applying the update rule: Q(s, a) += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q(next_state)) - Q(s, a)). This process results in the output Q-table [[0.65132156, 0.052902], [0., 0.]], where the values represent learned estimates of state-action values, with the second state's Q-values remaining zero because it is a terminal state and no further actions are taken from there."
