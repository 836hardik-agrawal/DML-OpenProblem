Implement a function to simulate a Markov Chain. The function should take a 2D numpy array representing the transition matrix (where each row sums to 1), an integer for the initial state index, and an integer for the number of steps to simulate. It should return a numpy array containing the sequence of state indices over time, including the initial state. Use numpy for array operations and random selections.
