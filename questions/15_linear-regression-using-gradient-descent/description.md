Write a Python function that performs linear regression using gradient descent. The function should take NumPy arrays X (features with a column of ones for the intercept) and y (target) as input, along with learning rate alpha and the number of iterations, and return the coefficients of the linear regression model as a NumPy array. Round your answer to four decimal places. -0.0 is a valid result for rounding a very small number.
