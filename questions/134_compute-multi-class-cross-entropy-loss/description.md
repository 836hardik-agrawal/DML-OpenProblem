Implement a function that computes the average cross-entropy loss for a batch of predictions in a multi-class classification task. Your function should take in a batch of predicted probabilities and one-hot encoded true labels, then return the average cross-entropy loss. Ensure that you handle numerical stability by clipping probabilities by epsilon.
