## Understanding the Adam Optimization Algorithm

Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an optimization algorithm commonly used in training deep neural networks. It combines ideas from two other optimization algorithms: RMSprop and Momentum.

### Key Concepts
1. **Adaptive Learning Rates**:  
   Adam computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients.
2. **Momentum**:  
   It keeps track of an exponentially decaying average of past gradients, similar to momentum.
3. **RMSprop**:  
   It also keeps track of an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients.
4. **Bias Correction**:  
   Adam includes bias correction terms to account for the initialization of the first and second moment estimates.

### The Adam Algorithm
Given parameters $ \theta $, objective function $ f(\theta) $, and its gradient $ \nabla_\theta f(\theta) $:
1. **Initialize**:
   - Time step $ t = 0 $
   - Parameters $ \theta_0 $
   - First moment vector $ m_0 = 0 $
   - Second moment vector $ v_0 = 0 $
   - Hyperparameters $ \alpha $ (learning rate), $ \beta_1 $, $ \beta_2 $, and $ \epsilon $
2. **While not converged, do**:
   1. Increment time step: $ t = t + 1 $
   2. Compute gradient: $ g_t = \nabla_\theta f_t(\theta_{t-1}) $
   3. Update biased first moment estimate: $ m_t = \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \cdot g_t $
   4. Update biased second raw moment estimate: $ v_t = \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) \cdot g_t^2 $
   5. Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate: $ \hat{m}_t = m_t / (1 - \beta_1^t) $
   6. Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate: $ \hat{v}_t = v_t / (1 - \beta_2^t) $
   7. Update parameters: $ \theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \alpha \cdot \hat{m}_t / (\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon) $

Adam combines the advantages of AdaGrad, which works well with sparse gradients, and RMSProp, which works well in online and non-stationary settings. Adam is generally regarded as being fairly robust to the choice of hyperparameters, though the learning rate may sometimes need to be changed from the suggested default.
