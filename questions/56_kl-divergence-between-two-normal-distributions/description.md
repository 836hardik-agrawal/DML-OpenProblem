## Task: Implement KL Divergence Between Two Normal Distributions

Your task is to compute the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between two normal distributions. KL divergence measures how one probability distribution differs from a second, reference probability distribution.

Write a function kl_divergence_normal(mu_p, sigma_p, mu_q, sigma_q) that calculates the KL divergence between two normal distributions.

The function should return the KL divergence as a floating point number.
