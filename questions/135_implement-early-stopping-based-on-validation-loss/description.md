Create a function to decide when to stop training a model early based on a list of validation losses. The early stopping criterion should stop training if the validation loss hasn't improved for a specified number of epochs (patience), and only count as improvement if the loss decreases by more than a certain threshold (min_delta). Your function should return the epoch to stop at and the best epoch that achieved the lowest validation loss.
