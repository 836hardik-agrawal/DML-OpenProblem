Implement a function that computes an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by a list of 2D vectors using the Gram-Schmidt process. The function should take a list of 2D vectors and a tolerance value (tol) to determine linear independence, returning a list of orthonormal vectors (unit length and orthogonal to each other) that span the same subspace. This is a fundamental concept in linear algebra with applications in machine learning, such as feature orthogonalization.
