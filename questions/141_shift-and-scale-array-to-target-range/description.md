Write a Python function `convert_range` that shifts and scales the values of a NumPy array from their original range $[a, b]$ (where $a=\min(x)$ and $b=\max(x)$) to a new target range $[c, d]$. Your function should work for both 1D and 2D arrays, returning an array of the same shape, and only use NumPy. Return floating-point results, and ensure you use the correct formula to map the input interval to the output interval.
