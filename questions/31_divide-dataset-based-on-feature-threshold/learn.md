## Understanding Dataset Division Based on Feature Threshold

Dividing a dataset based on a feature threshold is a common operation in machine learning, especially in decision tree algorithms. This technique helps in creating splits that can be used for further processing or model training.

### Problem Overview
In this problem, you will write a function to split a dataset based on whether the value of a specified feature is greater than or equal to a given threshold. You'll need to create two subsets:
- One for samples that meet the condition (values greater than or equal to the threshold).
- Another for samples that do not meet the condition.

### Importance
This method is crucial for algorithms that rely on data partitioning, such as decision trees and random forests. By splitting the data, the model can create rules to make predictions based on the threshold values of certain features.
